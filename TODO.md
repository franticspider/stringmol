#Testing and Refactoring

Stringmol is research code, but the time has come to improve its organisation.
We need to standardise parameter loading on the following run types:

0: 1 on 1
1: ALife XII
2: Con pop
4: Comass GA

##Parameters

These are the values that are used in the config files (missing parameters are standardised already)

###RANDSEED

0: not set
1: 
2: 
4:

###NSTEPS

0: arg_load sets A.nsteps
1: 
2: 
4:
